<p>Hello <?php echo $this->displayName?>,</p>

<p>welcome to the YAWIK demo. You've registered the first time via <?php echo $this->provider?>.</p>

<p>Login data were generated, so you can log into YAWIK directly. This should only show you that YAWIK can be used completely
without social networks.</p>

<p>
    We've set your role to a recruiter. So you can create jobs and manage applications.
    Changing the role is currently only possible directly on the mongo cli.
</p>


<p>Username: <?php echo $this->login ?><br>


Secret: <?php echo $this->password ?></p>


<p>Return to YAWIK and log in at: <a href="<?php $url = $this->serverUrl() . $this->url('lang/auth', array('lang' => 'en')); echo $url; ?>"><?php echo $url ?></a></p>


<p>regards,</p>
